<p>
  We are committed to:
  <ul>
    <li>Describing how your information may be used or shared in this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li>Using reasonable measures to keep your information secure.</li>
    <li>Never selling your information or sharing it with third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
    <li>Only sharing your information in limited circumstances, such as delivering your Verified Consumer Request to the parties that you designate, to improve this site, to comply with the law, or to protect you and others.</li>

</p>
<p><strong>Be Aware: For the protection of <%= COMPLIANCE_COMPANY[:company_name] %> and others, if you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you may not use this site.</strong></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how <%= COMPLIANCE_COMPANY[:company_name] %>, the organization that hosts this site, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of this site. It is essential to understand that, by using this site, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.</p>
<p>We do not sell or rent your Personal Information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to process your Verified Consumer Request and deliver that request to the business that you designate. We also use your behavior on this site to improve the usability and features that are offered.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>
  Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy. To help ensure your understanding of some particular key terms, here is a table of translations:

  </dl>
</p>
<p>Except as explained below, this Privacy Policy applies to our collection and handling of information about you that we receive as a result of your use of this site. This Policy also applies to information that we receive from our partners or other third parties. To understand more about what this Privacy Policy covers, please see below.</p>
<p>Not Applicable to Third Party Websites. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any website, offering, product or service of any third party, even if it links to our Site or incorporates the Service – please refer to the applicable privacy policies before deciding to provide any information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>A Note to Users Outside the United States.</strong>We are based in the United States. The Site and Services are controlled and operated by us from the United States and are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Site and Services you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Collection & Use of Information</h3>
<p>Types of Information We Receive From You & How We Get It</p>
<h4>Account Information & Registration</h4>
<p>Want to create an account? Great! Don't want to create an account? No problem!</p>
<p>You are not required to create an account to use this site, except under rare circumstances. However, you may choose to create an account for additional benefits. If you want to create an account, in most cases we require only a username and a password.</p>
<p>Your IP address is automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily to help prevent abuse. No other personal information is required to create an account: no name, no email address, no date of birth, no credit card information.</p>
<p>Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely. This is because we will need to retain the account for auditing and record keeping purposes.</p>
<p>To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you don't want to, you don't have to—it's as simple as that.</p>
<h4>GPS & Other Location Technologies</h4>
<p>If you consent, we can use GPS (and other technologies commonly used to determine location) to show you more relevant content. We keep information obtained by these technologies confidential, except as provided in this Policy.</p>
<h4>Metadata</h4>
<p>Sometimes, we automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you want to upload a photo, we may receive metadata, such as the place and time you took the photo, automatically from your device. Please be aware that, unlike location information collected using GPS signals described above, the default setting on your mobile device typically includes the metadata in your photo or video upload to this site. If you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.</p>
<h4>IP Addresses</h4>
<p>Finally, when you visit this site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location.</p>
<h4>Information Related to Your Use of This Site</h4>
<p>We want to make this site better for you by learning more about how you use them. Examples of this might include how often you visit this site, what you like, what you find helpful, how you get to this site, and whether you would use a helpful feature more if we explained it differently. We also want this Policy and our practices to reflect our community's values. For this reason, we keep information related to your use of this site confidential, except as provided in this Policy.</p>
<h4>Information We Receive Automatically</h4>
<p>Because of how browsers work, we receive some information automatically when you visit this site. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your browser, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's operating system, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to this site, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to this site.</p>
<p>Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with this site. For example, we use this information to administer the site, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with this site, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the site, and analyze trends.</p>
<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
<p>We actively collect some types of information with a variety of commonly-used technologies. These generally include tracking pixels, JavaScript, and a variety of "locally stored data" technologies, such as cookies and local storage. We realize that some of these technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes. So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.</p>
<p>Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data can be anything from text, and images, to Personal Information (like your IP address) and information about your use of this site (like your username or the time of your visit).</p>
<p>We use this information to make your experience with this site safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with this site, and to generally improve our services. If you ever come across a third-party data collection tool that has not been disclosed in this policy, please report it to us at our <%= link_to 'Contact Us', contact_us_path %> page.</p>
<h4>How We Use Information We Receive From You</h4>
<ul>
  <li>To provide to you custom content, notices and settings and to enhance your experience with this site.</li>
  <li>We will customize the Services, in some instances, at your direction; in all instances, in keeping with our legitimate purpose of processing your Consumer Requests.</li>
  <li>Sending emails with updates related to your Consumer Requests.</li>
  <li>We do not sell, rent, or use your email address to advertise third-party products or services to you. You can manage what kinds of notifications you receive and how often you receive them by going to your Notifications Preferences.</li>
  <li>For research and analytics.</li>
  <li>To fight spam, identity theft, malware and other kinds of abuse.</li>
  <li>To optimize mobile and other applications.</li>
  <li>To test features to see what works, understand how users interact with the site, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the site and analyze trends.</li>
  <li>As stated above, we can use commonly-used GPS & other location technologies to show you more relevant features. As a reminder, you can deactivate our access to these location technologies at any time, and still use the site.</li>
  <li>As stated above, we may automatically receive location data from your device. For example, if you upload a photo, please be aware that the default setting on your mobile device typically results in the metadata associated with your photo being included in the upload. As a reminder, if you do not want metadata sent to us and made public at the time of your upload, please change your settings on your device.</li>
  <li>When you visit this site, we automatically receive the IP address of the device (or your proxy server) you are using to access the Internet, which could be used to infer your geographical location. We keep IP addresses confidential, except as provided in this Policy. If you are visiting this site with your mobile device, we may use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas. We use this location information to make your experience with the site safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the site, and to generally improve our services.</li>
</ul>
<p>We engage in these activities to further our legitimate purpose and/or to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Sharing</h3>
<p>We share your information, with the third party(ies) that you designate, for the particular purpose of processing your Verified Consumer Request.</p>
<p>We will access, use, preserve, and/or disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to satisfy a valid and legally enforceable warrant, subpoena, court order, law or regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. However, if we believe that a particular request for disclosure of a user's information is legally invalid or an abuse of the legal system and the affected user does not intend to oppose the disclosure themselves, we will try our best to fight it. We are committed to notifying you via email at least ten (10) calendar days, when possible, before we disclose your Personal Information in response to a legal demand. However, we may only provide notice if we are not legally restrained from contacting you, there is no credible threat to life or limb that is created or increased by disclosing the request, and you have provided us with an email address.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you may have to a third party's request (whether it be civil, criminal, or governmental) to disclose your information. We recommend seeking the advice of legal counsel immediately if such a request is made involving you.</p>
<p>In the event that ownership of all or substantially all of <%= COMPLIANCE_COMPANY[:company_name] %> changes, or we go through a reorganization (such as a merger, consolidation, or acquisition), we will continue to keep your Personal Information confidential, except as provided in this Policy, and provide notice to you via the site and a notification via email (if we have your email address) at least thirty (30) calendar days before any Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We, or particular users with certain administrative rights as described below, may need to share your Personal Information if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to enforce or investigate potential violations of our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or any <%= COMPLIANCE_COMPANY[:company_name] %> policies. We may also need to access and share information to investigate and defend ourselves against legal threats or actions.</p>
<p>We hope that this never comes up, but we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe that it's reasonably necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm or death to a person, or to protect our organization, employees, contractors, users, or the public. We may also disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe it necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise assess and address potential spam, malware, fraud, abuse, unlawful activity, and security or technical concerns.</p>
<p>As hard as we may try, we can't do it all. So sometimes we use third-party service providers or contractors who help run or improve the site for you and other users. We give access to your Personal Information to these providers or contractors as needed to perform their services for us or to use their tools and services. We put requirements, such as confidentiality agreements, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your information consistently with, and no less protective of your privacy than, the principles of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you are visiting this site with your mobile device, we use your IP address to provide anonymized or aggregated information to service providers regarding the volume of usage in certain areas.</p>
<p>When we give access to personal information to third-party developers or researchers, we put requirements, such as reasonable technical and contractual protections, in place to help ensure that these service providers treat your information consistently with the principles of this Policy and in accordance with our instructions. If these developers or researchers later publish their work or findings, we ask that they not disclose your personal information. Please note that, despite the obligations we impose on developers and researchers, we cannot guarantee that they will abide by our agreement, nor do we guarantee that we will regularly screen or audit their projects.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Third Party Analytics and Tracking Technologies</h3>
<p>As discussed above, we (and our third party vendors) collect Analytics Information in part through the use of cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies. In some instance, we work with third party vendors to employ cookies for the purposes of collecting Analytics Information:</p>
<p>We use AppSignal to collect debugging data when a user experiences an error. For information on how AppSignal collects and processes data, please see their <%= link_to 'Privacy Policy', 'https://appsignal.com/privacy-policy' %>. We have executed a Data Processing Agreement ("DPA") with AppSignal.</p>
<p>We use Cloudflare to optimize our web traffic. For information on how Cloudflare collects and processes data, please see their <%= link_to 'Privacy Policy', 'https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/' %>. We have executed a DPA with Cloudflare.</p>
<p> We use GoSquared for programmatic notifications to users and analysis of user activity on our site. For information on how GoSquared collects and processes data, please see their <%= link_to 'Legal Pages', 'https://www.gosquared.com/legal/' %>. We have executed a DPA with GoSquared. </p>
<p>We use hCaptcha to protect our site from robots. For information on how hCaptcha collects and processes data, please see their <%= link_to 'Privacy Policy', 'https://hcaptcha.com/privacy' %>.</p>
<p>If you would prefer not to block the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, please see "Managing Your Information," below. Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Site or Service, as some features may not work properly.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Data Protection</h3>
<p>We strive to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures, policies, and procedures (such as access control procedures, network firewalls, and physical security) designed to protect our systems and your Personal Information. Unfortunately, there's no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we can't guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical measures or through violation of our policies and procedures).</p>
<p>We will never ask for your password by email (but may send you a temporary password via email if you have requested a password reset). If you ever receive an email that requests your password, please let us know on our <%= link_to 'Contact Us', contact_us_path %> page.</p>
<p>Once we receive Personal Information from you, we will keep it indefinitely for record keeping and auditing purposes.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Managing Your Information</h3>
<p>You may access, correct, amend, or delete certain Personal Information you may have provided us through your User account (if you are a User). If you are unable to do so, or have any questions about Personal Information we have collected about you, or would like to entirely delete your account, please <%= link_to 'Contact Us', contact_us_path %>.</p>
<p>If you would prefer to block cookies or other tracking technologies, most browsers and mobile devices all you to change your settings so as to notify you when you receive cookies or other tracking technologies are being used, and to choose whether or not to accept/allow it. Most browsers also allow you to disable or delete existing cookies or to automatically reject future cookies. You may also use third party tools, including browser plug-ins, to control your cookie preferences.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Information from Children</h3>
<p>Our Site and Service are not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information of a child under the age 13, we will take reasonable steps to delete such information from our files as soon as is practicable. Please <%= link_to 'Contact Us', contact_us_path %> if you believe we have any information from or about a child under the age of 13. </p>
<hr />
<h3>Important Information</h3>
<p><%= COMPLIANCE_COMPANY[:company_name] %> is a for-profit organization based in Boulder, Colorado, with servers and data centers located in the U.S. If you decide to use this site, whether from inside or outside of the U.S., you understand that your Personal Information will be collected, transferred, stored, processed, disclosed and otherwise used in the U.S. as described in this Privacy Policy. You also understand that your information may be transferred by us from the U.S. to other countries, which may have different or less stringent data protection laws than your country, in connection with providing services to you.</p>
<p>We are strongly committed to not sharing nonpublic information and Personal Information with third parties. In particular, we do not allow tracking by third-party websites you have not visited (including analytics services, advertising networks, and social platforms), nor do we share your Personal Information with any third parties for marketing purposes. Under this Policy, we may share your information only under particular situations, which you can learn more about in the “When May We Share Your Information” section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Because we protect all users in this manner, we do not change our behavior in response to a web browser's "do not track" signal.</p>
<p>
  Because things naturally change over time and we want to ensure our Privacy Policy accurately reflects our practices and the law, it may be necessary to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to do so in the following manner:
  <ul>
    <li>In the event of substantial changes, we will provide the proposed changes to our users at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the change via a message on this site.</li>
    <li>For minor changes, such as grammatical fixes, administrative or legal changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements, we will post the changes and, when possible, provide at least three (3) calendar days' prior notice via a message on this site.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>We ask that you please review the most up-to-date version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the site after this Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy on your part. Your continued use of the site after any subsequent version of this Privacy Policy becomes effective, following notice as outlined above, constitutes acceptance of that version of the Privacy Policy on your part.</p>
<p>If you have questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, or the information collected under this Privacy Policy, please <%= link_to 'Contact Us', contact_us_path %>.</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>
