There is a bug in the current version of the mysql2 gem that causes an error
when running tests in parallel. If you see errors like
`drb.rb:1259 run> terminated with exception (report_on_exception is true):`
then try the following:

Install the client libraries for MySQL 5.7 and reinstall the mysql2 gem using
those libraries.

```
gem uninstall mysql2
brew install mysql-client@5.7
gem install mysql2 -- --with-mysql-dir="/usr/local/opt/mysql-client@5.7/"
```

You will probably need to kill the currently running instance of spring before the tests will pass.
