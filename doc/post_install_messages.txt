Post-install message from encryptor:

Please be aware that Encryptor v2.0.0 had a major security bug when using AES-*-GCM algorithms.

By default You will not be able to decrypt data that was previously encrypted using an AES-*-GCM algorithm.

Please see the README and https://github.com/attr-encrypted/encryptor/pull/22 for more information.


Post-install message from attr_encrypted:

Additionally, there was a bug in Encryptor v2.0.0 that insecurely encrypted data when using an AES-*-GCM algorithm.

This bug was fixed but introduced breaking changes between v2.x and v3.x.

Post-install message from capistrano-passenger:
==== Release notes for capistrano-passenger ====
passenger once had only one way to restart: `touch tmp/restart.txt`
Beginning with passenger v4.0.33, a new way was introduced: `passenger-config restart-app`

The new way to restart was not initially practical for everyone,
since for versions of passenger prior to v5.0.10,
it required your deployment user to have sudo access for some server configurations.

capistrano-passenger gives you the flexibility to choose your restart approach, or to rely on reasonable defaults.

If you want to restart using `touch tmp/restart.txt`, add this to your config/deploy.rb:

    set :passenger_restart_with_touch, true

If you want to restart using `passenger-config restart-app`, add this to your config/deploy.rb:

    set :passenger_restart_with_touch, false # Note that `nil` is NOT the same as `false` here

If you don't set `:passenger_restart_with_touch`, capistrano-passenger will check what version of passenger you are running
and use `passenger-config restart-app` if it is available in that version.

If you are running passenger in standalone mode, it is possible for you to put passenger in your
Gemfile and rely on capistrano-bundler to install it with the rest of your bundle.
If you are installing passenger during your deployment AND you want to restart using `passenger-config restart-app`,
you need to set `:passenger_in_gemfile` to `true` in your `config/deploy.rb`.

RubyZip 3.0 is coming!
**********************

The public API of some Rubyzip classes has been modernized to use named
parameters for optional arguments. Please check your usage of the
following classes:
  * `Zip::File`
  * `Zip::Entry`
  * `Zip::InputStream`
  * `Zip::OutputStream`

Please ensure that your Gemfiles and .gemspecs are suitably restrictive
to avoid an unexpected breakage when 3.0 is released (e.g. ~> 2.3.0).
See https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip for details. The Changelog also
lists other enhancements and bugfixes that have been implemented since
version 2.3.0.
